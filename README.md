This is a fleet/status project.
it has almost different functionality. such as stop start. make a reaction by double clicking the statusCard.
there's a default fleets that's in there so feel free.
when ever you post a new fleet you will see the result at the right card.
every new fleet that user posts will have a #newFlag. while other's don't ðŸ˜’.

this project will continuing. means it's stopless.

Finally give a look ðŸ‘€ the condition inside displayFleet() function, that's where you can stop it.
